// Componets are the reusable building blocks 
// Any website or app can be broken down into the smaller building blocks -- Components
// It can be therefore also be built by creating and combining such components 

// html + css + java script ----> React Component
// Split COmplex user interfaces into smaller manageble components which potentially reusable in other places as well.
// Without components..it will be larger applications
