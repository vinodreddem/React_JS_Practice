      "MODULE REFERENCE\n",
      "    https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/io\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The following documentation is automatically generated from the Python\n",
      "    source files.  It may be incomplete, incorrect or include features that\n",
      "    are considered implementation detail and may vary between Python\n",
      "    implementations.  When in doubt, consult the module reference at the\n",
      "    location listed above.\n",
      "\n",
      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    The io module provides the Python interfaces to stream handling. The\n",
      "    builtin open function is defined in this module.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It\n",
      "    defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no\n",
      "    separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are\n",
      "    allowed to raise an OSError if they do not support a given operation.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and\n",
      "    writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide\n",
      "    an interface to OS files.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its\n",
      "    subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer\n",
      "    streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.\n",
      "    BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access\n",
      "    streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding\n",
      "    of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text\n",
      "    interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO\n",
      "    is an in-memory stream for text.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments\n",
      "    of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.\n",

      "    DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE\n",

      "       I/O classes. open() uses the file's blksize (as obtained by os.stat) if\n",
